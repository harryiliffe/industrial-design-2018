### My given location is an AIRPORT
Due to the Wellington airport being close we have visited and taken photos to later analysis the building layout and the products found inside.

#### A few quick observations:
* Wellington Airport prioritises open space to move people through.
* They do not have consistent seating but a wide range.
  * The airport provides fixed rows of chairs, tables in the food court and a few floating chairs
  * Each Cafe/Shop has there own style of seating
* They have a range of lighting throughout the airport (some good, most bad)
* A lot of people sit on the floor against the wall.
* There are very few charging ports and those that are provided are hard to access.
* There is no areas for children and parents.
