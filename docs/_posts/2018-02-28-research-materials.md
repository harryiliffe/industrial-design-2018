### Material One: 100% Wool Felt
Felt is a textile material that is produced by matting, condensing and pressing fibres together (wikipedia). It is often soft and can be made in a range of different strengths and thickness.
It is highly recyclable as it will biodegrade but still durable.

### Material Two: PLA
PLA, an abbreviation of Polylactic Acid, is a thermoplastic polymer but unlike most thermoplastic polymers it is derived from renewable resources such as sugarcane and cornstarch.

PLA has a wide range of uses but we often interact with it the most when 3D printing.


### Material Three: Organic Modelling Foam
As part of the Resilience project at fablabwgtn, they have been experimenting with mushrooms with the goal of creating Mycelium blocks. These blocks are environmentally friendly, being made from sawdust and mushrooms, and will discompose when no longer needed. The blocks can be used as a building material or as a replacement for modelling foam.
