After deciding that these were the main focus points I was going to hit on I decided to come back and do some more research.

### We Make Carpets

A great example of an interactive children's installation is the [We Make Carpets](https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/multimedia/we-make-carpets/) installation at the NGV Triennial.

"Children can arrange tangram shapes to create a new floor piece; make dashes of colour with rope on the wall; colour match a mural of pegs with pool noodles; and play with colour and shape using velcro swatches," says the museum.

### London Science Museum

The [London Science Museum](https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/) has a lot of great examples.
