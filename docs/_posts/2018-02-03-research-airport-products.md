A few of the products areas we identified ([excluding furniture](https://harryiliffe.github.io/industrial-design-2018/research-airport-furniture/)) were lighting, crowd control, and signage and advertising.

### Lighting
Like everything else in wellington airport, there was a wide range of lighting.

#### Tape barriers / Stanchion
Used excessively at the wellington airport were tape barriers. In every area of the airport these barriers were used as an quick, easy to set up solution for direction people.

The company that supplies Wellington Airport is [Vanguardgroup](https://www.vanguardgroup.co.nz/pedestrian-control/retractable-belt-queue-control-barriers.html?___store=default)

#### Signage
Another import aspect to the airport is knowing where you are going. Whilst Wellington is comparatively small to other countries airports, it still needs signage to help customers find their way.
Wellington Airport uses a mixture of different signage, the main type being overhead backlit signs.

#### Advertising
In the wellington airport it seemed that almost every space had some form of advertisement.
