### First Concepts

*/ Images /*
Furniture Concepts

I found these quick furniture concepts really uninspiring and not what I would normally design ever.
I decided to take a different approach and look at an **Educational, Entertaining, and Preparatory** children's installation.

### Concept 1

This idea of making a entertaining installation for children drove the rest of my concepts


### Concept 2

This idea is based on the same principles as concept 1


### First Test
I decided to make a quick proof of concept for concept 1.
This will give me hands on indication about how it will operate and if it poses enough opportunity for development.
