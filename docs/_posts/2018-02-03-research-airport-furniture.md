### Wellington Airport
Wellingtons Furniture is very inconsistent.
They have many rows of fixed seating provided by Zoeftig, a number of tables and chairs in the food court area, a few desks with power outlets and one rather randomly placed floating couch.

Another issue with Wellington Airport is each cafe provides there own tables and chairs. This leads to even more inconsistence across the airport.

#### FURTHER ISSUES
* Most of the seats are 4 seaters which, from research, we know people will not fill completely.
* The seats offer no area of luggage storage
* The seats also have no power outlets. Customers who need to charge there devices are there drawn the few power outlets where there is insufficient seating
* The seating rows offers no variations. They are ranged in fixed rows all facing forwards.
