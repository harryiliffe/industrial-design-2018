I found these quick furniture concepts really uninspiring and not something that I was interested in exploring more. I want to design something more fun and exciting than just furniture.
I decided to take a different approach and look at an **Educational, Entertaining, and Preparatory** children's installation.

[I went back a did some research around this.](https://harryiliffe.github.io/industrial-design-2018/research-educational/)


This idea of making a entertaining installation for children drove the rest of my concepts.

## Concept 1

Whilst visiting Te Papa, I found this installation
The installation allow children to insert small colourful blocks into a wall to resemble a drawing being coloured in.
This reminded me of another tactile installation for children called Hands On: We Make Carpets. This art project invited children to come and play with different materials and collectively make large compositional installations.
[We Make Carpets](https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/multimedia/we-make-carpets/)

Using these ideas as inspiration my concept involves children collaborating to slot blocks into a wall and gain a better understanding for how the airport works.

One aspect to this, that I thought could be fun, is bringing the idea of missions/objectives. Slot these blocks into a control panel to load the luggage.

## Concept 2
![Concept 2 Sketch]({{site.imageurl}}/sketches/CONCEPT-06.jpg)
This concept allows a child to move people and their luggage through an airport, going through all the steps (ie: check in, luggage drop off, security, etc.), and ending up on the plane. It fulfils all 3 criteria I provided and has room for a lot of development.

### Prototype
I made a quick proof on concept.
This will give me hands on indication about how it will operate and if it poses enough opportunity for development.

## Concept 3

Concept 3 is similar to concept 2, but instead of moving people and luggage along tracks you move marbles (or some other object) through a track using a series of interaction points.
