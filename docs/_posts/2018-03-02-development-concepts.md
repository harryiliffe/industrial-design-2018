I found these quick furniture concepts really uninspiring and not something that I was interested in exploring more. I want to design something more fun and exciting than just furniture.
I decided to take a different approach and look at an **Educational, Entertaining, and Preparatory** children's installation.

[I went back a did some research around this.](https://harryiliffe.github.io/industrial-design-2018/research-educational/)


This idea of making a entertaining installation for children drove the rest of my concepts.

### Concept 1

Whilst visiting Te Papa, I found this installation
The installation allow children to insert small colourful blocks into a wall to resemble a drawing being coloured in.
This reminded me of another tactile installation for children called Hands On: We Make Carpets. This art project invited children to come and play with different materials and collectively make large compositional installations.

### Concept 2

#### First Test
I decided to make a quick proof of concept for concept 1.
This will give me hands on indication about how it will operate and if it poses enough opportunity for development.
